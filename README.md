The following was tested on both Windows and Linux S.O.:

Analysis_Plots_4.0.py - RMSD, RMSF and Radgyr data analysis. This code needs numpy and matplotlib modules with an python 3.6+ compiler (if you dont usually use Terminal, install Visual Studio Code, which runs on Windows and Linux). 

The following was tested only on Linux S.O.:

ASM.py - Molecular Dynamics simulation manager (tested on AMBER18 and AMBERtools18+). Automates the process of performing a molecular dynamics simulation using the AMBER/AMBERtools computational packages.
  Ps: AMBERtools is an open source package of AMBER and both can be found on https://ambermd.org/
